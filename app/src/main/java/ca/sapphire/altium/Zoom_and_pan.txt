Constants:
    (xView, yView) = size of screen
    (xSheet, ySheet) = size of schematic sheet

To set the initial scale so the full schematic appears:
    Calculate the scale factor that allows the sheet to fit in the view in both X and Y
        This is done by dividing the View size by the Sheet size
            Scale = abs( View / Sheet )
    Take the smaller of the two X and Y scales as the scale to be used.

    Note that View size is always positive, but the Sheet size can actually be negative
    since it is actually represents the plotable bounds of the sheet.  To convert from a
    Cartesian XY plane where X increases to the Right and Y increases to the Top to the
    Android XY plane where X increases to the Right and Y increases to the Bottom we need to
    multiple all Y values by -1.  We can't use a scale=-1 because that results in all the text
    being flipped top to bottom and rendered upside down.  (In other words, the Y vector for
    Android is 180' different from the Y vector for Cartesian geometry.)

To centre the schematic on the page:
    Calculate the difference between the screen size and the scaled sheet size
        This is done by multiplying the Sheet size by the Scale and subtracting it from the View
            Difference = View - (Sheet * Scale)
    Take half that value as the offset
        Offset = Difference / 2
